# OpenRCT2 BingoSync Server

**OpenRCT2 BingoSync** is a server tool that interacts with Bingosync.com, allowing you to create bingo boards for OpenRCT2 challenges.

This only works when you have the openrct2-bingo plugin installed, get it at: https://github.com/bingothon/openrct2-bingo

## Usage

Download the appropriate executable for your platform from the `releases` folder and run it as follows:

### Linux
```bash
./openrct-bingosync-linux-v1.0.0
```

### macOS
```bash
./openrct-bingosync-macos-v1.0.0
```

### Windows
```run in cmd
openrct-bingosync-win-v1.0.0.exe
```

**Note:** Ensure you have network access to Bingosync.com, as this server interacts with it to create and manage bingo boards.
